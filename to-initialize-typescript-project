mkdir node-app
cd node-app
npm init -y
npx tsc --init

Go to tsconfig.json file and uncomment outdir and put './dist' and in rootdir put './src' like below 
`
"outDir": "./dist",
"rootDir": "./src",    
`

Make a .ts file and write ts code in it. After writing ts code then run this:
tsc -b

It will convert the ts file into js so that you can run that file by 
npm index.js or npm start
